# Destined-2022 GUIDE!

This guide is split up in 4 sections:
- [A simple guide,](#a-simple-guide)
- [Combat](#combat),
- [The world](#the-world),
- [Spells and items](#spells-and-items),

The simple guide explains the basics of game-play, while  
the others provide a more in-depth explanation of their subjects.  


---
_A simple guide._
-
Upon launching the game, you are confronted with the main menu.  
Here you can choose to start playing by loading one of three save-files.  
Alternatively you can change some settings or exit the game.  

The player can return to the main menu at any time in the escape menu (using the   
ESC key by default). Note that returning to the main menu without saving first can   
cause loss of progress.

#### Save-files  
When choosing to load a file, you can choose between 3 files.  
File 1 and 2 are identical on first launch.  
File 3 can be seen as a _sandbox mode_ as it has absurdly high statistics and movement speed.  

When playing on any of these files, the player can save by either hitting the _SAVE_ button   
after pressing escape or by interacting with one of two checkpoints.  
Saving to a file replaces the data previously written to that file.  

#### Movement
Once a file has been loaded, the player starts in the bottom left corner of the screen (or where  
they last saved) and can explore the room by using the movement controls (WASD by default).    
Some tiles can be interacted with by pressing the interaction key (R by default).  
In the starting room most intractable tiles are animated with a sparkle effect,  
but interacting with the training dummy starts an example battle.  
When ready, the player can move on to the next rooms by entering the gradient tiles.  

#### Battle
Battles are started by interacting with the dummy or randomly while walking through the field.  
Battles are turn-based. A battle ends when either the player or all enemies run out of health (HP).  
During the player's turn you get the option to fight using stamina, use magic, use items or some   
basic actions.  

When a battle ends, the player is rewarded with 'soul' for each enemy they defeated.  
Soul functions like Exp in some other games, when enough soul is collected the player gains an   
increase in some statistics.  

When all enemies are defeated, the player also earns some gold which can be used to buy items.

#### Stores and Statistics  
Gold earned in battles can be spent on items in stores.  
Stores are found around the world and open a menu, when interacted with.  
In stores the player can buy and sell items in exchange for gold.  
Only 12 items can be held at a time.  

The player can see what items they currently have by pressing the open statistics key (I by default) when walking  
around. In this menu many other statistics can be seen as well, like speed and gold.  

#### Spells
The player can unlock spells by interacting with some tiles.  
The player has 5 spell slots and can swap what spells are currently unlocked.   
Some spells provide passive effect and can not be used in combat, others are provide more  
noticeable active effects.  

---
_Combat_
-
This is a more detailed explanation on how combat works.  
The turn order for each battle is decided by the speed statistic of the combatants.  
To see the statistics of the enemies, press their image and keep the cursor hovering within its  
boundary. In this info card, a small description  of the enemy is also provided.  

-\
Walking on a tile in the field has a 1/12 chance to start a battle.  
The player then has a 2/7 chance to face a normal foe and a 1/7 chance to face a powerful foe.  
There is a 4/10 chance to add another enemy using the same odds as before, except the enemy that  
was already selected has a 1/7 less chance to be selected again.  
This has a 3/10 chance to repeat once more resulting in a fight against 1~3 random enemies.  

-\
Each unique enemy has a different range of moves:  

- Offensive foe:  

      - Heavy attack, 
        [Deals medium damage, cannot be used after a Double attack or a Heavy attack]

      - Double attack, 
        [Deals small damage twice, cannot be used after a Double attack or a Heavy attack]

      - Light attack, 
        [Deals small damage]

- Defensive foe:

      - Defend, 
        [provides the 'defending' status effect for one turn, cannot be used after a Defend]

      - Self heal, 
        [Heals a small portion of health, cannot be used after a Defend, can only  
         be used when not at full health]

      - Light attack, 
        [Deals small damage]

- Supportive foe:  

      - Light attack, 
        [Deals small damage]

      - Buff health, 
        [Increases the maximum health of an ally by 10, and heal it 5 health, cannot be used twice]

      - Heal any, 
        [Heals a medium portion of any allies health]

      - Enchant weapon, 
        [provides the 'enchanted weapon' status effect to an ally or increases its duration]

- Powerful foe:  

      - Defend, 
        [provides the 'defending' status effect for one turn, cannot be used after a Defend]

      - Heavy attack, 
        [Deals medium damage, cannot be used after a Double attack]

      - Double attack, 
        [Deals medium damage twice, cannot be used after a Double attack]

      - Self heal, 
        [Heals a small portion of health, cannot be used after a Self heal, can only  
         be used when not at full health]
-\
During the player's turn you can choose to fight.  
Fighting gives you the option to either perform a _Light_ or a _Heavy_ attack.  
These attack cost stamina and deal damage based on the _Damage_ statistic.  
The _Light_ attack costs less stamina and deals less damage than the _Heavy_ attack.  
Most damage increasing status effects only have effect on these attacks and not magic.
##### <Magic and Items>

-\
If the player does not choose to fight, they can choose to use _Magic_ instead.  
Magic does not cost stamina (except for one case), but has a cool-down.  
The cool-down prevents a spell to be used for a varying amount of turns after use.  
Each spell has a unique cool-down and a unique effect. Some spells are _passive_, meaning  
they cannot be used in combat but provide continuous effects without a cool-down.  

-\
The player can also choose to use an item.  
Items are single-use only and have a cool-down shared with all others of its type.  
Items provide direct effects on use like healing the users health or stamina or even increasing  
their maximum health.  

Their limited use makes items quite valuable.  

-\
Lastly during their turn the player may choose to use an action.  
There are two possible actions you can use:    

	- Defend,
	 [provides the 'defending' status effect for one turn, decreasing the damage 
      taken by all hits during its effect]

	- Run,
	 [Ends the battle, the player still gains the soul for each defeated enemy, but  
      since not all enemies were defeated the player does not earn any gold]

-\
When the player does not use any stamina in their turn, they regain some.  
The amount gained varies per action that they did use (most actions return 3 stamina).  

-\
When the player loses all their health during battle, the battle ends immediately.  
The player then returns to the last checkpoint that they saved at.  
They return to maximum health, but lose half their gold. The enemies that were  
defeated still grant their soul, but no gold is earned. Simular to the _run_ action.
